### Usage

Throughout this documentation, there are some recurring symbols that provide additional functionality when clicked.

* :mag: - Search on GitHub.

	This runs a GitHub search on the `WordPress/WordPress` GitHub repository, often targeting a specific file. This is done to avoid directly linking to line numbers in the Core, as these could easily go stale.

	From within the search results page, you can click on a line number in front of the found text string to be brought directly to that specific location in the file.
